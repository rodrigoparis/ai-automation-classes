## Workflows

### L3_Get_Execution_Workflow.json
This workflow retrieves execution data. It is often used as a sub-workflow or utility to inspect past runs.

### L3_Chart_Workflow_with_Sub_Execution.json
Demonstrates how to generate charts based on data processed within n8n. It likely involves calls to sub-workflows to gather data.

### L3_Optimizacion_LLM_Batching_Cach_prod.json
A production-ready example showing optimization techniques for LLM calls:
*   **Batching**: Processing multiple items in a single request to save time and tokens.
*   **Caching**: Storing results to avoid redundant computations for identical inputs.
